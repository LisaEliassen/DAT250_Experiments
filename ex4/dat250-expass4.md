## Report for "Software Technology Experiment 4: Microservices and REST APIs":
I have chosen to only do Experiment 1 and 2.

### Link to code:
https://github.com/LisaEliassen/dat250-sparkjava-counter

### Technical Problems:
When running the code and tests I get an error: "SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder"",
but I chose to ignore since the tests passed.

### Issues I did not manage to solve:
None, other than the StaticLoggerBinder thing.
