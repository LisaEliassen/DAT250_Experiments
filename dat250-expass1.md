### Technical problems encountered with the Heroku platform:
When I first started with the installation of everything that I needed, I was using a MacBook Air. Everything, except Postgres and Heroku was already installed on it from previous courses I have taken.
Installing Postgres went fine, but I encountered a problem when I tried to install Heroku, because I did not have the latest MacOS version. I also did not have the space to install the latest MacOS version.
I therefore had to put everything on hold until I got another laptop. 

Thankfully, I got a new laptop at the start of this week (week 35), and I have successfully installed everything I needed, and managed to get through the Heroku tutorial.

### How I have validated (checked) that the software development environment is working:
For Maven and java, I just checked that it was installed with the "mvn -v" and "java --version" command in the terminal, and the rest got checked while doing the Heroku tutorial, since it would have given error messages if things were not installed correctly or something like that.

### Pending issues with this assignment which I did not manage to solve:
None :)
